# The Biography of Jiangxia Yu
Jiangxia was born on 23rd October 1996. He was named after two provinces in China, Zhe**Jiang** and Ning**Xia**, one for his parents' hometown and one for his birthplace.\

After enrolled in UCL for his undergraduate degree, Jiangxia decides to name himself Rory because he had seen so many non-Mandarin speakers having trouble pronouncing his Chinese name.
During his time in UCL, Rory had courses in:

* Economics

* Econometrics

* Programming

After graduating from UCL, Rory decided to take a gap year because of the *pandemic*. During the gap year, Rory worked on two internships in one security company and one Big 4 consultancy. More details can be found on Rory's [LinkedIn page](https://linkedin.com/in/roryyu).
